# The IEEE RTS 24 bus system is a standard test case for power flow analysis.
# This configuration file defines the buses, generators, loads, and transmission lines
# for the IEEE RTS 24 bus system in YAML format.
# It can be used with GridFM for simulation and analysis purposes.
# The file includes detailed parameters for each component to accurately represent
# the electrical characteristics of the system.
# For more information on the IEEE RTS 24 bus system, refer to:
